        I watch you grow away from me in photographs
        And memories like spies
        And salt betrays my eyes again
        I started losing sleep and gaining weight
        And wishing I was was ten again
        So I could be your friend again
        
        These days we go to waste like wine
        That's turned to turpentine
        It's six AM and I'm all messed up
        I didn't mean to waste your time
        So I'll fall back in line
        But I'm warning you we're growing up
        
        I heard you found some pretty words to say
        You found your little game to play
        And there's no one allowed in
        Then just when we believe we could be great
        Reality it permeates
        And conquers from within again
        
        These days we go to waste like wine
        That's turned to turpentine
        It's six a.m and I'm all messed up
        I didn't mean to waste your time
        So I'll fall back in line
        But I'm warning you we're growing up
        
        We're OK I know we're OK
        
        These days we go to waste like wine
        That's turned to turpentine
        It's six AM and I'm all messed up
        I didn't mean to waste your time
        So I'll fall back in line
        But I'm warning you we're growing up
